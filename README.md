FFMPEG Batch Converter

This script can be placed in any directory (preferrably your users home directory)
Supported OS Linux, tested on Ubuntu 16.04
Requires latest version of FFMPEG available from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Once you've downloaded the latest version, simply edit the script to point the FFMPEG variable to it's location on your system.
From there, enter your extension of choice in DES_EXT as well as your source directory in SRC and destination for the file in DEST.

I did not create this script, I simply modified it for my own purposes.
